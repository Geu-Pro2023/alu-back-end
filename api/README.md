**The Role of APIs in Back-End Development**

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are central to back-end development. They define how clients interact with a server, allowing for data exchange and functionality access. APIs are vital for modularity, security, and scalability in back-end systems. They find practical use in data retrieval, user authentication, content delivery, payment processing, and notifications. In a world driven by technology, understanding and effectively using APIs is fundamental for modern software development.
